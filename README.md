### TODO
- [ ] change converters/normalizers to use `np.where`
- [ ] figure out how to avoid looping over cols in converters
- [ ] complete normalizers for Sex/Race so that all cases are covered
- [ ] wrap file/df reading or writing so we don't have to know exactly where a file is located
  - [ ] also to facilitate easy pipeline chaining
